<p>Today was a challenging day trying to introduce the game setup class.</p>
<p>I couldn't decide on an elegant solution to the problem, I considered different approaches and finally settled on passing in a game object into the game setup class and then call a host of setter methods on it.</p>
<p>Like so..</p>
<p>[code lang="text"]<br />
if (userChoice == 1) {</p>
<p>game.setHumanVsComputerGame();<br />
}<br />
else if (userChoice == 2) {<br />
game.setHumanVsHuman<br />
}</p>
<p>else if (userChoice == 3) {<br />
game.setComputerVsComputer()<br />
}<br />
}<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>I found the this was probably the best option I had to get me to continue moving forward. However I don't like the idea of mutating the game object, instead what I would prefer is to construct a new game object through a factory perhaps.</p>
<p>I look forward to the iteration meeting so I can cover this issue with my mentor.</p>
