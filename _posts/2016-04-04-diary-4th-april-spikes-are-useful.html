<p>Today I paired with Rabea on adding persistence to my Contact management app. I feel I don't pair enough and so for the next few weeks I'll be doing a pairing exchange with every apprentice. It goes like this one day I spend 1hour pair programming on their project, another day we spend 1 hour pairing on mine. This way both apprentices get help and not too much time is taken away from completing our respective iterations.</p>
<p>Rabea and I started looking at the project, firstly she wanted to use the app to get an idea of what she was dealing with. Once completed we delved into the code.</p>
<p>I began explaining what was the feature requested. "A user should be able to see their contacts on restart." I had introduced a IContactStorage interface that declares a contract of the required methods to store contact data. It could be argued that this interface was perhaps introduced too early, however I introduced it because I had Dependency Inversion Principle in mind when previously the CreateContact process was dependent on a low level module ContactStorage. Now with the CreateContact being dependent on an abstract, it is easier to swap our different types of storage mechanisms.</p>
<p>Now it was a case of introducing a new class that implements the IContactStorage interface, however while we were discussing this, we realised we hadn't decided on how to implement the solution. Which meant....SPIKE time!</p>
<p>I'm beginning to see the real value of spikes. I think I saw the benefit when I once paired with Mateu on something and he did it.</p>
<p>So I plan on using Spikes a lot more often, I imagine it'll be useful I'm not familiar with a framework or a language, and of course, do the simplest thing that'll will work.</p>
