<p>Picking up from where we left off from stream reading, this time we'll be discussing writing.</p>
<p>Here is the code below we will be discussing.</p>
<blockquote><p>private MemoryStream stream;</p>
<p>1 public void Write(string message) {<br />
2        using (StreamWriter streamWriter = new StreamWriter (stream)) {</p>
<p>3        streamWriter.Write (message);<br />
4        streamWriter.Flush ();<br />
}<br />
}</p></blockquote>
<p>Line 1 is our method declaration and we will be passing in a string argument.<br />
Line 2 has the keyword "using", which makes certain that we expose of the streamWriter object once it's been used.<br />
Streamwriter is a class that implements, TextWriter it is used for writing characters to a stream using encoding(default encoding is used if not specified)</p>
<p>In this line it's taking a MemoryStream object.</p>
<p>Line 3 uses the write method which can take a plethora of object types, such as 'Char', 'String', 'Double', look in the MSDN documentation for more details.</p>
<p>The methods writes a text representation to the stream, which is nice and handy.</p>
<p>Line 4 Will flush the stream writer meaning it will clear out the buffer but the stream will remain open. To close the stream we can call StreamWriter's close method.<br />
