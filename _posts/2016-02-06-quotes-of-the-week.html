<li>I first heard this from <a href="https://twitter.com/ukutaht" target="_blank">Uku</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>"work in short iterations because it enables more feedback and transparency. We work in pairs because it provides more accountability. We test drive our code because it gives us more confidence in our solutions. We know and practice SOLID design principles because they lead to cleaner, more maintainable code." -</p></blockquote>
<p>Myles Megyesi</p>
<blockquote><p>" As a professional, I knew that before I could identify the cause of the bug, I needed a mental model of the business logic and a high-level overview of how that portion of the system's code was structured so that I did not inadvertently create more bugs and cost the business more money." -</p></blockquote>
<p>Rick Winfrey</p>
