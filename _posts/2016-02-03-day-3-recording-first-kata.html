<p>While recording my first performance of my roman numerals kata, I felt a sense pressure. There's nothing wrong with pressure, only when the pressure leads to mistakes.</p>
<p>During my 3rd attempt of the kata without recording, I was comfortable and made few mistakes, laid back coding. The moment I began my 4th attempt in which I was recording, mistakes galore! I couldn't generate a new class, nor a method, the basics had gone out of the window.<br />
I stopped at the 3rd test Â case to take a break and clear my head. I was genuinely surprised by my nerve, I felt it's perhaps due to a lack of practice.</p>
<p>This thought came to me, perhaps we practice again and again, so we can remove nerves and reduce mistakes. It's when a task becomes second nature, that's when we perform better.</p>
<p>Whatever is the reason, I do believe that this couldn't be a clearer sign that I am not yet 100% comfortable performing this particular kata, which means, more deliberate practice is required.</p>
