<p>Here is a list of the most useful aliases to my workflow, I'm always looking to add more.</p>

<p>It has  greatly improved my productivity by at least 200%! (yes I tested..)</p>
<p>Interestingly, I also learnt the difference between bashrc and the bash_profile, this had me head scratching for a good hour as none of my aliases were working in "bashrc".</p>
<p>Then I read this great article  <a title=".bash_profile vs .bashrc" href="http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html" target="_blank">.bash_profile vs .bashrc </a></p>
<p>The gist of it,   bash_profile: Gets executed to configure your shell settings before initial command prompt.</p>
<p>however if you've already login, the bashrc is called.   Apple being the special nerds they are, Mac Os X terminal (runs login shell) will executed the bash_profile.</p>
