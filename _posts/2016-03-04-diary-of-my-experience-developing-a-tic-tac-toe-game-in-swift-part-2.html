<h3>Vim for Xcode</h3>
<p>I installed XVim for Xcode, which as you would guess is a plugin which enables Vim bindings, I'm so happy, I feel....almost... comfortable in Xcode, need a couple more days with it. A lot of improvements have been made to it since the last time I used it back in 2010 when I developed a Mac app (seems like a different life now)</p>
<p>XVim works really well, it does a lot of what you would expect to do in vim. It even comes with it's own vimrc, called.... xvimrc, how awesome is that?!</p>
<h3>Tic Tac Toe progress update</h3>
<p>I created 18 IBOutlets which connected to their corresponding UIImageViews and UIButtons on storyboard.</p>
<p>I'm going to take a break from tic tac toe and come back to it another time as I feel it would be more beneficial right now to spend some time doing the Roman numerals kata in Swift and Xcode, to improve the speed of my workflow.</p>
<h3>Unit Testing Framework</h3>
<p>Naturally I'll be TDD'ing the roman numerals kata so I'm currently looking for a suitable unit testing framework that is easy to setup, easy to use and similar to RSPEC or xUnit family.</p>
