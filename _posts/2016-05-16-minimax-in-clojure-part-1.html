<p>Okay, I admit. I was over confident in saying to my mentor that implementing minimax in Clojure would be straightforward, perhaps naively I thought that the language was well suited for minimax.<br />
Unsurprisingly, minimax in Clojure is challenging.</p>
<p>I spent yesterday trying to break it down into itâ€™s smallest parts. I began firstly by test driving the score method. As this was a component of the Minimax that I could test drive and what I most understood.</p>
<p>[code lang=clojure]<br />
(defn score [board player]<br />
(let [winner (board-logic/winner board)]<br />
(if (= winner player) 10<br />
(if (board-logic/game-drawn? board) 0 -10))))<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>The next part wasn't so easy, I'm not sure if I'm missing something or if I am still thinking in a OOP style way to solving this problem. Maybe it is a really easy if you think in a functional way, maybe not.</p>
<p>I'm going to carry on working on it tomorrow, hopefully gain some insight.</p>
