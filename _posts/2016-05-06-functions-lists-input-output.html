<p>I paired with Daisy on the roman numerals Kata in Clojure. Daisy doesn't have much experience with Lisp or Clojure, so this was a great opportunity for me to teach someone a language that I had recently been learning.</p>
<p>The first thing that I felt was important to cover is parenthesis..(there's so many of them!). Okay while they're important (meaning lost minutes would attest), there are four concepts that are more important.</p>
<p>Those are.......</p>
<p>Functions, Â Lists, Input, Output.</p>
<p>When tackling a problem, think of these four and they will lead you to a possible solution.</p>
<p>These four concepts aren't in complete isolation of each other, they connect and flow between.</p>
<p>A rudimentary example of adding a number to a list of our favourite numbers.</p>
<p>```clojure</p>
<p>(def my-favourite-number [7 11 24 50 100])</p>
<p>(cons 5 my-favourite-numers)</p>
<p>````</p>
<p>It contains a function called "cons" that takes a number and a list as an an input. Finally outputs the result.</p>
<p>We of course could also have a function that takes another function as an input, such as the map function which takes a functions as an input and returns a collection as it's output.</p>
<p class="p1">There are many examples out. Thinking in this approach has helped me a lot in understand functional programming and clojure.</p>
