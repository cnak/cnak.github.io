<p>Challenge</p>
<p>Commit code to a public repo for 30 days.</p>
<p>A while ago I spoke about doing a 30 day github streak <a title="30 days of github" href="https://fleetingdev.wordpress.com/2015/01/07/30-days-of-github-challenge/" target="_blank">challenge</a>. Well I went for 100 days instead :)</p>
<p><strong> What are github streaks</strong></p>
<p>Github streaks show how many consecutive days a user has committed a change or raised an issue to a repository.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h3>Why attempt a consecutive streak?</h3>
<p>I was inspired by <a title="ryan seys 177 days of github" href="https://ryanseys.com/blog/177-days-of-github/" target="_blank">Ryan Seys's post</a> and <a href="http://natashatherobot.com/streak-github-mistakes/" target="_blank">Natashatherobot</a> post on Githubstreaks, highly recommend reading them.</p>
<p>I believed by committing code every day for 30 days that I would improve as a programmer. By committing code, it made me think carefully about code quality more so because my repos were public.</p>
<p>At times I would spend hours getting a piece of code to work and end up committing a single line. Which was okay as long as I committed something. The goal of the challenge after all was to get in the habit of delivering worthwhile code.</p>
<p>First week was particular difficult as I adjusted to the pressure of committing something worthwhile every day, especially on the weekend. By the 2nd week it became a habit, I would eat, sleep, code.</p>
<p><strong>30th Day</strong></p>
<p>When the 30th day finally arrived, I didn't want to stop, I felt like I could do this forever! So I decided,I would aim for 90 days.</p>

<p><strong>60th Day</strong></p>
<p>I started to feel a change, I felt that if I kept this up that I would become a competent web developer. I started to see the effort paying off in small ways. For example, understand new concepts a little quicker than before, solving small problems more elegantl, it also made me realise how little I knew. So I pushed on.</p>
<p><strong>87th Day</strong></p>
<p>Slowly my enthusiasm began dwindling, at this point I wanted the challenge to end.</p>
<p><strong>90th Day</strong></p>
<p>I felt victorious, I reached my goal but.... what if I went for 100 days, that seemed like a nicer round number.</p>
<p><strong>97th day</strong></p>
<p>I went to bed at 11pm and realised I hadn't yet commited. I got up, commited a code fix that was bugging me the previous day and went back to bed.</p>
<p><strong>99th day</strong></p>
<p>At the point, I started to feel burnt-out. I had reached my capacity. I had already completed my original goal, there would be no shame in stopping now, but I was too close to stop.</p>
<p><strong>100th Day.</strong></p>
<p>This was a wonderful day, I got up and all I wanted to do was commit one more code so I can take a break for a while. Do something else, read a non-technical book, spend time playing video games, anything as long as it wasn't to do with coding.</p>
<p>A breather was needed.</p>
<p>Once I committed the last piece of code, I felt great. I had pushed mysel, learnt a lot about coding and myself in the process.</p>
<h3>What I learnt</h3>
<p><strong>Don't break the chain.</strong></p>
<p>I got this idea after reading a lifehacker article explain how Seinfield stays productive[http://lifehacker.com/5886128/how-seinfelds-productivity-secret-fixed-my-procrastination-problem].</p>
<p>Imagine as if each day in which you commit a piece of code is connected via a chain. The day you don't commit, you break that chain. Simple but effective approached to productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Remind yourself as to 'why are you doing this'</strong></p>
<p>It's important to remember why we are doing something. Times when the challenge felt bothersome, I reminded myself that I was ultimately doing this so I can improve as a developer.</p>
<p><strong>It's a marathon not a sprint</strong></p>
<p>Learning to deliver develop great software is a long journey, so I shouldn't rush it and should at times take breaks to avoid burnout.</p>
<p><strong>Better to deliver something than not at all.</strong></p>
<p>This challenge forced me to deliver code rather than waiting until a piece of code was 'perfect' or the project was 'perfect'. This is not a good attitude to have, so I wanted to eliminate it, I wanted to become a person that delivers code rather that just talks about wanting to do it. This reminded me a lot of a Steve Jobs quote "Real artists ship".</p>
<h3>What now...</h3>
<p>I'm going to take short break, I'm not going to commit anything for a while. I'm still going to code, of course! I enjoy doing it, however I'm going to code without the pressure of committing something. Going back to coding for the fun of it, experimenting without any expectations.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day I might do a 'Pull request streak' challenge! :)</p>
