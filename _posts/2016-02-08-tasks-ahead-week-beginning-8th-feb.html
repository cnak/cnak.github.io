<p>My tasks for this week is to implement a echo server in c#, a human v human tic tac toe game and finally begin reading Clean Code by Robert Martin.</p>
<p>Echo server.</p>
<p>I've never attempted a echo server and to be honest I wasn't sure what it entailed.<br />
From my research it is a server that listens for input via TCP and relays back what it receives. For example, a user would connect to the server, then enter a piece of text such as "Hello World!", the server then prints back "Hello World!.</p>
<p>This is going to be interesting as I have to use mocks which I don't have any experience with.</p>
<p>Tic Tac Toe: human vs human.</p>
<ul>
<li>3x3 Board</li>
<li>Console</li>
</ul>
<p>Enough said really.</p>
<p>Finally "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin</p>
<p>I'm stocked to have an opportunity to read this book, I've been meaning to dedicating time to this book but I have only read a couple of pages.</p>
<p>A busy week ahead, plus I still have some required blog post readings from last week.</p>
<p>Bring on the week!</p>
