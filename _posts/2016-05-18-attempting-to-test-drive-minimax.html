<p>One of the reason I struggle with minimax is that it's a difficult to test drive.<br />
I like to first do the smallest thing possible that would get me started and make me feel like I'm doing something of value.</p>
<p>I outlined a rough idea of what I want from the minimax algorithm. The first simplest thing to test is the scoring of a final board game state.<br />
10 for a win, -10 for a lost and 0 for a draw.</p>
<p>[code lang=clojure]<br />
(describe &quot;final-score&quot;<br />
(it &quot;scores 10 for a winning move&quot;<br />
(should= 10 (score winning-board &quot;X&quot;)))<br />
(it &quot;scores 0 for a draw game&quot;<br />
(should= 0 (score drawn-board &quot;X&quot;)))<br />
(it &quot;scores -10 for a lost game for player X&quot;<br />
(should= -10 (score lost-board &quot;X&quot;))))</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>The second part is to have a test that will force to generate possible game states. I've achieved that by scoring an incomplete game. This means that the inter-score function needs to make potential moves on a board to get the board into a final state which it can score.</p>
<p>[code lang=clojure]<br />
(def possible-winning-board<br />
[&quot;X&quot; &quot;X&quot; &quot;-&quot;<br />
&quot;O&quot; &quot;O&quot; &quot;X&quot;<br />
&quot;X&quot; &quot;O&quot; &quot;O&quot;])<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>A simple board to test is a board with only one move remaining, this involves no loop and we should return only one possible board from this.</p>
<p>[code lang=clojure]<br />
[&quot;X&quot; &quot;X&quot; &quot;X&quot;<br />
&quot;O&quot; &quot;O&quot; &quot;X&quot;<br />
&quot;X&quot; &quot;O&quot; &quot;O&quot;])<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>So the inter-score will return a 10 as the next possible move will always be a win.</p>
<p>[code lang=clojure]<br />
(def possible-losing-board<br />
[&quot;X&quot; &quot;X&quot; &quot;O&quot;<br />
&quot;X&quot; &quot;X&quot; &quot;-&quot;<br />
&quot;O&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;O&quot;])<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>We assume that the opponent will pick the best move to win, so this will mean player "X" will lose</p>
<p>Final board</p>
<p>[code lang=clojure]<br />
(def possible-losing-board<br />
[&quot;X&quot; &quot;X&quot; &quot;O&quot;<br />
&quot;X&quot; &quot;X&quot; &quot;-&quot;<br />
&quot;O&quot; &quot;O&quot; &quot;O&quot;])<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>The game is over so the inter-score, scores the final game state from player "X" perspective, returning -10.</p>
<p>[code lang=clojure]<br />
(def possible-drawn-board<br />
[&quot;-&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;X&quot;<br />
&quot;X&quot; &quot;O&quot; &quot;O&quot;<br />
&quot;O&quot; &quot;X&quot; &quot;X&quot;])</p>
<p>(describe &quot;scores possible move&quot;<br />
(it &quot;scores incomplete winning board&quot;<br />
(should= 10 (inter-score possible-winning-board &quot;X&quot;)))<br />
(it &quot;scores incomplete losing board&quot;<br />
(should= -10 (inter-score possible-losing-board &quot;X&quot;)))</p>
<p>;currently failing<br />
(it &quot;scores incomplete drawn board&quot;<br />
(should= 0 (inter-score possible-drawn-board &quot;X&quot;))))<br />
(defn score-multiple [boards mark]<br />
(score (first boards) mark))</p>
<p>(defn current-mark [moves-left]<br />
(if(even? (count moves-left))<br />
&quot;O&quot;<br />
&quot;X&quot;))</p>
<p>(defn generate-possible-boards [board mark]<br />
(let [open-spots (board-logic/remaining-moves board)]<br />
(for [open-spot open-spots]<br />
(board-logic/make-move board open-spot mark))))</p>
<p>(defn inter-score [board mark]<br />
(if (board-logic/game-over? board)<br />
(score board mark)<br />
(score-multiple (generate-possible-boards board mark) mark)))<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>To get the currently failing state to pass I imagine I will have to have a loop and a way to switch players, so that a full game is played. Then I can score that completed game.</p>
<p>To be continue</p>
