<h3>What is a perfect player?</h3>
<p>A game where you win or you draw but never lose.<br />
If two perfect players play, it should always be a draw</p>
<h3>Calculate all possible moves and calculate the best move</h3>
<p>A way to be a perfect player is to calculate all possible moves and give a score to each of those moves. A way to predict the future.</p>
<h3>How can we explain how we score</h3>
<p>Me as the current player wins :) (yup I'm the best) I get 10 points<br />
I lost.. :( I lose 10 points and the the 10 poiunts goes to the other player.<br />
It was a draw. We both get .......no points.</p>
<h3>MINImising &amp; MAXimising moves</h3>
<p>The current player always plays to maximise their points by playing to win, and in turn minimise the opponents score.</p>
<h3>Minimax</h3>
<p>Minimax scores a game once the game is over, if not it continues recursively going through all possible generated game states.</p>
<p>Possible games are generated by simulating a move, always first with the current player, then finding the next available move and switching the current player and repeat.</p>
<p>Once that's done, a collection containing all the scores and their associated moves. For each of the states, the minimax score is added to the scores list.</p>
<p>If it's player "X" then the maximum score from the list is return, if the player is "O" than the minimum score is return from the list.</p>
