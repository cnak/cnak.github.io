<p>I've recently switched from ERB to <a title="HAML" href="http://haml.info/" target="_blank">HAML</a> and I have to admit it's an absolute joy to use, not sure why I didn't make the switch sooner.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I find the best way to learn a new framework or language is to put it through a short litmus test. For Haml I built a small CRUD app, after about 15 minutes I couldn't see myself going back to erb.</p>
<p>I looked at an old rails project I did using erb, I suddenly had this urge to rewrite it using haml.</p>
<p>Haml makes a lot of sense to me, since switching to Ruby, I've wanted everything that I use to be less verbose (here's looking at you Java!). In the same vain of though, I plan on switching to CoffeeScript for my Javascript development, I manage I will have similar of Haml as I will of CoffeeScript.</p>
<p>Haml is based on the principle that markup should be beautiful. It accomplishes this by enforcing indentation ( I had to learn this the hard way), respects the DRY principle by removing the need of closing tags on elements.</p>
<p>The only pet peeve I have is how you declare a html5 doc by writing "!!! 5", seems odd to me, perhaps there's a logic reason to this that I'm not aware of.</p>
<p>There's a few helpful haml tools out there, such as <a title="html2haml" href="https://github.com/haml/html2haml" target="_blank">html2haml</a>, <a title="haml-lint" href="https://github.com/causes/haml-lint" target="_blank">haml-lint</a></p>
