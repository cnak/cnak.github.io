<h2>What is Rack</h2>
<ul>
<li>uses Ruby's built-in WEBrick web server</li>
<li>provides a web server interface</li>
<li>a protocol for building composing web apps</li>
<li>collection of middleware utilities</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web server interface</h2>
<p>Rack provides an interface so that you don't have to deal with some elements of the server. Such as listening on a port, accepting connections, parsing HTTP responses and requests.<br />
This gives you more time to spend on writing what the application does and providing value.</p>
<h2>Protocol</h2>
<p>Rack protocol is simply a Ruby object with a call method, being a proc it has a "call" method. The method arguments are the environment variables which describe the incoming request. The return value is an array with [status, headers, body].</p>
<ul>
<li>status: The HTTP status code</li>
<li>headers: hash of HTTP headers for the response</li>
<li>body: Body of the response.<br />
A simple HelloWorld app in Rack</li>
</ul>
{% highlight ruby %}
#config.ru
class HelloWorld
 def self.call(env)
    [ 200,
    {"Content-Type" ; => "text/plain"},
    ["Hello World!"]
 end
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Entering 'rackup' in the terminal will start our rack up</p>
<p>Accessing the up and running website by going to "localhost:9292"</p>
<p>And That's it!</p>
<p>Within moments we have an app running.</p>
