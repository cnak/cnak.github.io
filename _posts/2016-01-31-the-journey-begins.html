<p>On Monday I start my apprenticeship at 8thLight.</p>
<p>I first heard about 8thLight while mentoring at CodeBar. At the time I didn’t know but would find out later, that their staff frequently volunteer their time at various community events, something I myself also try to commit myself to.</p>
<p>One of the Resident Apprentices told me about the Apprenticeship program and how much he was learning and enjoying himself, I was immediately intrigued. The more we talked about what we considered what makes great software, I realised how much my values with 8thLight were aligned.</p>
<p>I began attending the 8thLight University, every Friday for roughly 8 weeks, pair programming with the apprentices and craftsmen. I particular enjoyed the workshops that were held, especially Daniel's workshop on deep listening. Seeing how well the apprentice/mentor model worked in person, increase my conviction of wanting to become a Resident apprentice.</p>
<p>Now as I begin my journey as an apprentice, I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to work with smart, kind hearted people who genuinely care about my development as a software craftsmen.</p>
<p>Let the adventure begin!</p>
