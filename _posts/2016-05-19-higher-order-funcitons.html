<p>We are used to in object oriented programming to pass variables into parameter arguments, return values from methods.</p>
<p>What higher order functions allow us to do is pass in functions themselves into other functions as parameter arguments</p>
<p>A popular example of a higher order function is the 'map' function found in various languages such as Clojure and Ruby. The map function takes a collection type and a function as it's parameter and then applies the function on each element within the collection, finally return the result as a new collection. Pretty powerful stuff.<br />
Another example of a function within the core clojure and ruby library is the filter function, which can take a function as a predicate, then filtering out elements from collection based on the result of that function.</p>
<p>Higher order functions don't stop just there, as we can return functions as an output from a function.<br />
Returning functions from other functions can be a way to reduce duplication. Scenarios whereby you have a conditional split and the only difference is that if result "a", call "functionA". result "b", call "functionb".</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>An example of passing in a function.</p>
<p>[code lang=clojure]<br />
&lt;br /&gt;(defn double [function x]<br />
(function (function x)))</p>
<p>(double #(+ % 3) 6)<br />
;=&gt; result 12<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Another example showing how we concat a collection of number and return elements odd or even depending on the function that we pass through</p>
<p>[code lang=clojure]<br />
(defn concat-some<br />
[f col col2]<br />
((fn [x] (filter f x))<br />
(concat col col2)))</p>
<p>(concat-some even? [1 2 3] [4 5 6])<br />
; result (2 4 6)<br />
(concat-some odd? [1 2 3] [4 5 6])<br />
; result (1 3 5)<br />
[/code]</p>
