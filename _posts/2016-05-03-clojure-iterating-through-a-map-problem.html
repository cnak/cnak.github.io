<p>I've been working on my Tic tac toe's board. Starting from the test that I believe will give my the most value, the game-over. As this is the behaviour that will then require testing the win, draw and loss behaviour.</p>
<p>After implementing each row winning combination, I noticed a pattern and refactored the code to make the duplication more apparent, which would allow me to futher refactor to a generalize solution.</p>
<p>[code lang="clojure"]<br />
(defn- top-row [board]<br />
(cells-the-same? board [0 1 2])<br />
)</p>
<p>(defn- middle-row [board]<br />
(cells-the-same? board [3 4 5])<br />
)</p>
<p>(defn- bottom-row [board]<br />
(cells-the-same? board [6 7 8])<br />
)</p>
<p>(defn- left-column [board]<br />
(cells-the-same? board [0 3 6])<br />
)</p>
<p>(defn- middle-column [board]<br />
(cells-the-same? board [1 4 7])<br />
)<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>The code above are very similar, the difference being the input. How could I split this to be more general method which would then operate on the collection.</p>
<p>So I wrote some pseudo code</p>
<p>[code lang="clojure"]<br />
;not working code</p>
<p>(def winning-positions [] [ [0 1 2] [3 4 5] [6 7 8] [0 3 6] [1 4 7]])</p>
<p>(apply (#(cells-the-same? board %) on each item in multi-dimensional array (pass-this-collection-to-the-left winning-positions))<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>I have the basic idea on how I want to approach it, but not sure on the implementation.<br />
I'm hoping tomorrow I will have a better clue on how to implement it in code</p>
