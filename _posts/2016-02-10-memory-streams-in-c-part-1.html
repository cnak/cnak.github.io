<p>I have been working with streams the last couple of days and they were confusing at first, especially the way C# does it differently to Java.</p>
<p>With the help of MSDN and nearby kind craftspeople, it's beginning to become clearer.</p>
<p>We will use aÂ simple example to explain how they work.</p>
<p>Let say we want to create a console that reads and writes to a stream. Luckily for us in C# we have a handy class called 'MemoryStream' which shockingly creates a stream.</p>
<p>We can pass this MemoryStream into our constructor like so</p>
<blockquote><p>public AwesomeConsole (MemoryStream stream) {<br />
this.stream = stream;<br />
}</p></blockquote>
<p>We are assigning it to a private field here so we can use it later in our read and write methods.</p>
<p>Lets move on to the Read method.</p>
<blockquote><p>public string Read () {<br />
var streamReader = new StreamReader (stream);<br />
return streamReader.ReadToEnd ();<br />
}</p></blockquote>
<p>Here we are using the 'var' keyword which does away for the need for explicitly type declarations which is quite nice (not at the time though)</p>
<p>We instantiate a new StreamReader object, passing a 'Stream' to it's constructor.</p>
<p>The StreamReader class reads characters from a byte stream, depending on the characters that you're willing to accept, you may have to include a require Encoding such as UTF8Encoding. For the sake of simplicity we won't doing that.</p>
<p>Streams are like old fashion cassette tapes( go further back, Betamax tapes), in that we can rewind them, fast forward to a moment in the stream. In this case we want to read to the end of the stream using the appropriately name method 'ReadToEnd' which returns us our string object.</p>
<p>Tomorrow will be part 2... writing to streams.</p>
<p>Ced</p>
