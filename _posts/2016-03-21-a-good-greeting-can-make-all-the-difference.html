<p>At 8thLight we shake hands every morning with every member when we arrive and when we leave the office for the day.</p>
<p>When I first started over 7 weeks ago, I thought that this was peculiar, over time I've began to noticed the subtle difference it makes.</p>
<p>I consider greeting your colleagues every morning a sign of acknowledgement and a sign of respect. Yes it's a simple act that I personally feel makes a difference in our interaction with each other in a positive way. In fact I like to greet everyone with a smile, to let them know I'm happy to see them and happy to work with them.  I believe  working relationship are better when you start your first interaction with someone with a smile and and handshake. It starts the day on a positive tone.</p>
<p>In Karate, before every practice session. The Students and the Sensei would bow before the dojo and bow to each other as a sign of respect towards one and another, regardless of belt status.</p>
<p>Over time my greeting handshakes with some of my colleagues have involved into a standard fist bump to even with some of the apprentices, an elaborate handshaking choreography(which I love).</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Software development comes down to the people involved, I strongly believe better working relationships is part of the recipe that can produce better software.</p>
