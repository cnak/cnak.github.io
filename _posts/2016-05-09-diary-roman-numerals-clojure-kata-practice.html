<p>I started today attempting to solve the Roman numerals kata, ended the day trying to shave off every possible second.</p>
<p>. A kata that I've done countless times but never done before in Clojure but more importantly in a functional language.</p>
<p>How difficult could it be?</p>
<p>It was surprisingly challenging because you have handle conditionals differently, loops differently and not mutable variables. Â Usually when doing the kata in a language like C#/Ruby, you can happily declare a variable, such as a string which you mutate and finally return once you've built it. None of that in Clojure. Now I can say I'm kinda glad.</p>
<p>I'm tired of mutated states, in my cases it's not needed, at times it makes the code harder to read, at worse it causes side effects.</p>
<p>I'm plan on practicing on my kata to get it down to 7 minutes, it's currently around the 10minutes mark and I keep making needless errors. I find the final recursion part of the solution when the conversion array is revealed takes too long. Ideally there should be a short gap between running the tests and still be in the green phase.</p>
<p>I need to take a deeper look at how I'm approaching it, I'm sure there's something I'm missing.</p>
<p>Final part of the jigsaw is to pick an awesome song to pump me up during the Kata presentation on Friday.</p>
