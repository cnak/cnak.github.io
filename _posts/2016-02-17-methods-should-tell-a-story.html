<p>Before completing my echo server, my mentor noticed that I wasn't using test doubles effectively. He suggested that I do spike of the echo server to get a better idea how the final implementation would look like.</p>
<p>Once I had completed the spike, I was happy with the start method initially but since completing it again using TDD and with the use of my private methods, the start method is looking a lot clean.</p>
<p>Exhibit A</p>
<blockquote><p>public void Start() {</p>
<p>string message = "";</p>
<p>PromptUser();<br />
while (IsExitCode(message)) {<br />
output.Write(message + "\n");<br />
}<br />
}</p></blockquote>
<p>Exhibit B</p>
<blockquote><p>public void Start() {<br />
PrintWelcomeMessage();<br />
while (true) {<br />
ReadUserInput();<br />
ReadSpecialCaseInput();<br />
if (CheckIfExitInput())<br />
break;<br />
Echo(input);<br />
}<br />
}</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only was Exhibit A in fact hiding some side effects in the private methods ( looking at your isExitCode) it wasn't telling a story the way Exhibit B, tells a story. Exhibit B has aa nicer flow because each method name is descriptive about it's execution.</p>
<p>Methods should be short as possible and tell a story and not only this, it makes it easier to unit test behaviour.</p>
