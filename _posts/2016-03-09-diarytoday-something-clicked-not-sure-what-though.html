<p>While I was introducing different game types in my tic tac toe game, using constructors like so..</p>
<p>[code lang=text]<br />
public Game(Board board, IGameConsole, console, HumanPlayer humanPlayer, ComputerPlayer computerPlayer)</p>
<p>public Game(Board board, IGameConsole, console, ComputerPlayer computerPlayer, ComputerPlayer computerPlayer)</p>
<p>public Game(Board board, IGameConsole, console, HumanPlayer humanPlayer, ComputerPlayer computerPlayer)<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>I realised that this is how I'm supposed to do it, first introduce the duplication then refactor. I tell myself this all the time but sometimes I get frustrated and I instead want to take a shortcut which invariably leads me to a complex path.<br />
It seems so obvious now and I now this but time again and again it comes back to me displining myself. This is why we do katas, it teaches us this! I guess there's nothing quite like repetition to make best practices stick.</p>
<p>So next step will be to generalize this duplication, whether it is to create a new class or a method, I'll decide once I'm at that crossroad, but for now, I'll leave the duplication there as I slowly refactor other parts of the code to make it cleaner.</p>
<p>I have a strong feeling I'll be learning and relearning this kind thing again and again through my apprenticeship, it feels like 2 steps forward, 1 step back sometimes.</p>
<p>But hey, it least it's a step forward.</p>
