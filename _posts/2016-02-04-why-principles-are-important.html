<p>Today I learnt more about what it means to be a craftsman and how it's so much more about the code a craftsman writes.</p>
<p>While it's about many principles and skills. These are the ones I learnt today.<br />
How a craftsmen conducts themselves at every step of the way. During demonstrations, meetings, programming, etc.<br />
Being professional when writing the code, to always attempt to write the best code you can.<br />
To have humility at all times, to not pretend to know more than you know.<br />
Estimate to the best of one's ability, this one I hope I really understand one day.<br />
I think one of the most important skill of all is,communication.</p>
<p>Communication related to code, does the code communicate clearly it's intention?<br />
Estimation, do you communicate the estimation clearly to the client?<br />
Do you communicate what can and can't be done in the current time frame? .</p>
<p>While there's many principles that will help, I think it's ultimately about delivering value to the client, through clean code, clean communication and this is done by having strong principles in place.</p>
