<h2>Test Names should influence an Object's API</h2>
<p>As I've written before, tests are important. We should keep our tests as clean as our production code. With this in mind it should follow the simple rules.</p>
<p>I will be using the Conway's Game of Life as an example, written in C#</p>
<p>[code lang=java]<br />
[Test]<br />
public void NewWorldIsEmpty(){<br />
var world = new World();<br />
Assert.AreEqual(0, world.living_cells.count);<br />
}<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>This first test name indicates that it's concern with an empty world but the assert statement itself doesn't. It doesn't even have the word empty in it.<br />
A unit test is the first consumer and the first interaction with the future concrete class (if you're doing TDD). It represents how the component(s) are going to be used.<br />
We wouldn't want a user to have to look at the internal implementation of the world object just to found out if it's empty.</p>
<p>A cleaner test would look like this.</p>
<p>[code lang=java]<br />
[Test]<br />
public void NewWorldIsEmpty(){<br />
var world = new World();<br />
Assert.IsTrue(world.IsEmpty);<br />
}<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>This updated method reads a lot better, there's a symmetric between the name of the method and what the assert is doing, in addition it hides the internal of the object and making it a more readable API.</p>
