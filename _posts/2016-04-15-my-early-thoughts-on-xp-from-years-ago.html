<p>I remember years ago when I first heard about eXtreme programming and my only thought was that I preferred it's branding than Waterfall's.</p>
<p>I started to hear work collegues around me wanting to adopt some of the principles. Such as code reviews, increasing communication with stakeholders and the introduction of short sprints.</p>
<p>All of this wanting came from a good place, but unfortunately a lot of people felt that taking the entire XP principles wouldn't work on a larger scale. I'm starting to believe that it wasn't that XP doesn't work in large scale, perhaps it's that XP require a certain company culture.</p>
<p>Pair programming requires developers with good communication skills, team players and a certain amount of discipline. One of the beneifit of pair programming is that it's a form of continious code review, which I'm confident leads to increased code quality.</p>
<p>Another tenent of XP is uniti testing of <em>all</em> code. When I first heard this idea years ago I initially thought that can't be possible on a large scale system. How would one write all those tests and still ship the software before the sun burns out? That's where Test Driven Development comes in.</p>
<p>By now TDD to me is second nature to me. I incredibly uncofortable when a feature hasn't got an associated test, or when I see a developer writing code without first writing a test. However years ago, it made sense to me to write the test afterwards, or worse, no test at all because it's a simple feature and what could possibly go wrong?? right?</p>
<p>These were my early thoughts on Xp, I'm happy to say I know more now and appreciate the various values of XP, and will be talking about it some more in future posts.</p>
